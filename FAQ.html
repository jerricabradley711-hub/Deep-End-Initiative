    <h3>Q1: Why the Deep End Initiative? How did you come up with it?</h3>
    <p>Initially, the concept of personal narratives were something of an inspiration to us, as we thought exploring and finding the depth within yourself could be pretty impactful, buy maybe impractical here. After some more discussion, we realized that we all had an appreciation for art and literature, and taking the time to break down and discover different aspects of either media, which was nice since it alluded back to the concept of depth, which we also enjoyed. That love for meaning is still expressed, but just in regard to external things rather than internal! </p>
    <h3>Q2: How do I find the meaning in art/literature? </h3>
    <p>Slow-looking! This involves the idea of having the patience, time, and dedication to slow yourself down long enough to fully absorb the information a specific piece is trying to express. Meaning  cannot be garnered by glancing over a painting, or a few sentences within a book. If you truly wish to be more thoughtful, you have to make the choice to stop and think critically. Additionally, it helps to get creative, and sometimes making reaches for answers or interpretations (even if they aren’t correct) can just help you get in the mindset of thinking more conceptually. Loosen up, be patient, and give something a try. </p >
    <h3>Q3: What makes finding the meaning in things fun for your group? </h3>
    <p>We as a group tend to think more conceptually and find a lot of enjoyment in  picking things apart because it’s like putting together a mental jigsaw puzzle! There’s something deeply rewarding about breaking a composition down into fragments, building it back up, and finding out that you were right about your speculations, and that you can now see everything as one complete picture. We also find it fun because analysis gets the creative brain juices flowing, and helps us create more complex, compelling works of our own. </p>
    <h3>Q4: How do I make meaning in my own art/writing? </h3>
    <p>Like mentioned above, sometimes it helps us to go out and do some slow-looking at things to get the conceptual parts of our brains warmed up. Inspiration is a massive part of creation. Another thing that can be helpful (depending on the context you wish to apply to your work) is knowing history, and knowing how to apply analogies to it. If your goal is to discuss societal injustice during a specific period in time, but you want to add a little extra impact, use metaphors and analogies to help yourself along. A great example of this is George Orwell’s Animal Farm, a book that critiques the USSR, but is told through the lens of simple farm animals. </p>
    <h3>Q5: What about if I struggle with writing/art, and don’t feel like I’ll successful? </h3>
    <p>Creative mediums like writing and art can be exceptionally difficult, not becaue of the restrictions others place on us, but the restrictions we place upon ourselves. Allow yourself to be loose, to write with terrible grammar and disjointed ideas thrown all over the pages, because what matters then is that you have actually written something! Allow what you do to not make sense for a while, and clean it up as you go. Greatness cannot be achieved in one day. The same goes for making art. Let your concepts look like chicken scratch, let your forms be unbalanced. The goal here is experimenting and learning to find what works. And, for both writing or art, you can always phone a friend or professor if you still need a little extra support.</p>
