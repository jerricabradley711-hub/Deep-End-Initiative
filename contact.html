    <h2 style="color: #a088df; font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-size: x-large;">Perhaps share your own depth of thought here on a deeper meaning from art or literature, we'd love to hear of it!</h2>
        <p>Witness here the humble word generator, an idea spawned by the collective Deep End Initiative mind! The goal with the word generator is to have a little bit of fun, while also putting into practice and exercising your ability to connect things to deep meanings or make something significant out of them. Give this a whirl, get a randomized word, and see how much meaning you can make with one just one tiny word! Be creative, be loose, be imperfect with it! This is just to have some fun, and to practice thoughtfulness and conceptualization. </p>
