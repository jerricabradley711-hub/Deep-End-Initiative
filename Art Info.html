    <h3>BOOKS </h3>

<p>- Our Missing Hearts, Celeste Ng. 

In this book, Celeste Ng describes a dystopian world in which minorities are deemed “unsafe" by the government, and accused of committing crimes on their home country’s behalf. This leads to a widespread, virulent hatred, and is a commentary of the year 2020, when Asians were discriminated against and hate-crimed for the crime of “bringing COVID into the U.S.” </p>

 

<p>- The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald.   

In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald presents a commentary on wealth in excess, and how this immense wealth can deeply impact individuals, communities, and societies. Fitzgerald also critiques capitalism, and how the rich stay rich, while the poor tend to stay poor. </p>

 

<p>- The Giver, Lois Lowry. 

This book tackles the issue of the danger of a collective hivemind, and warns against not having any form of free thinking or individuality within society. It also expresses the extreme dangers associated with lacking free thought. </p>

 

<p>- Among the Hidden, Margaret Peterson Haddix.  

This book places a heavy emphasis on the importance of fighting for your freedom, as well as finding the courage to resist oppressive or controlling groups of people. 

 

<p>- 1984, George Orwell.  

Meant to be a forewarning of what our government will likely look like someday, 1984 stands as a brutal warning against the government’s increasing control, and interest in personal lives. This book also expresses the dangers of conformity and a collective mind, and how people are easily manipulated if shuffled into these collective minds. </p>

 

<p>- Anthem, Ayn Rand.  

This book is a critique of totalitarian and communist governments. It goes into a discussion on the danger of having a collective mind with no individuality among people.   

 

<p>- Animal Farm, George Orwell.  

This book uses the allegory of animals creating a society based on equality among them after usurping the place of the farmer, until the pigs become just as corrupt, taking control and changing the rules for their benefit. This is an allegory for the Stalinist era of the Soviet Union and the corruption of power. </p>

 

<p>- The Handmaid’s Tale, Margaret Atwood.  

The book describes a setting in time where birthrates and fertility have declined to the point that fertile women are being forced into servitude as handmaids to bear children for the ruling class families. It is a critique of totalitarianism and how far others will go to preserve their power over others. </p>

 

<p>- Fahrenheit 451, Ray Bradbury. 

This book is a critique and overview of book banning and book outlawing, and it describes a world not so different from ours where people called “firemen” are appointed to burn all books that they find. It describes the importance of free thinking and intellectual freedom.</p>

 

<h3>ART</h3> 

 

<p>- Unequal Marriage, oil painting by Vasili Pukirev.  

This painting is a critique on younger women being married to older men whose wives have died. To further show his distaste for this practice, the artist painted himself into the crowd looking onto the scene with disgust for the man and pity for the young woman whom he may have loved. </p>

 

<p>- The Lion of Lucerne, high relief by Bertel Thorvaldsen. 

This relief is a monument to the Swiss soldiers that were slaughtered in the French Revolution. Even in its final moments, trapped in agony, the Lion of Lucerne is loyal, guarding a shield engraved with the Fleur-de-lis, a commemoration of the soldiers' loyalty in defending the Tuilerie Palace against an insurrection. The lion is placed across the lake where people can witness his grief, but cannot reach him to comfort him. This was intentional, and alludes to the way that no one was able to comfort the Swiss soldiers that were slaughtered in battle but could only mourn for them from afar. </p>

 

<p>- Stone Breakers, oil painting by Gustav Courbet. 

This painting depicting two men working in a field breaking rocks for the roads in the wealthier districts of town. The painting is a commentary on the class system of France and alludes to the fact that this job is all the older man has ever done and all the younger boy will ever do. The piece was allegedly meant to convey unease, as the father and son's faces are unseen, and their tools are somewhat remnant of weaponry. Both of these things allude to their lack of status or importance in the world, as well as the demonization of those who are poorer. </p>

 

<p>- The Dying Gaul, sculpture by Epigonus.  

This statue was commissioned by Attalus I as a commemoration of the Greek's victory over the Celts, though it carries a doubled meaning. While it does represent a triumphant moment for the victor, it also shows the Greek’s deep respect for their foes, as Greek society was a “warrior culture,” and valued honor, glory, and strength. The Dying Gaul, pictured in his final moments, is depicted with sincerity, as he isn’t seen as insignificant despite being the enemy. In fact, the twisted gold wire wrapped around his neck is a Torc, a Celtic adornment only given to noblemen or exceptional warriors. He was recognized as still being human, and deserving of decency. </p>
